    <strong>Steps:</strong>

    <ol>

        <li>
            Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. 
            Blend on high until smooth and set aside. 
        </li>

        <li>
            
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. 
            Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; 
            continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.

        </li>

        <li>

            Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. 
            Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.

        </li>

        <li>

            Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. 
            Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. 
            Do not remove the lid or stir rice.


        </li>

        <li> 

            Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. 
            Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.

        </li>

        <li>

            After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. 
            Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro. 

        </li>
        
        
    </ol>    
        
    
       <p> <strong>Note:</strong> If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. 
        Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. 
        Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again.</p>
